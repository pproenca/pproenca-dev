# Writing Style Guide

This guide defines the writing style for blog posts. The style is modeled on clear, human, conversational essay writing.

## Core Principles

### Sentence Rhythm

- Vary sentence length intentionally
- Use short punchy sentences for emphasis: "Failure isn't fun. Success is."
- Use longer sentences for explanation and nuance
- Avoid monotonous sentence patterns

### Paragraph Structure

- Keep paragraphs brief: 2-4 sentences maximum
- Each paragraph makes ONE point
- White space creates breathing room for ideas

### Word Count

- Target 250-400 words total
- Concise is better than comprehensive
- Every sentence must earn its place

### Tone

- Conversational yet authoritative
- Personal experience over abstract theory
- Confident but not arrogant
- Show don't lecture

### First Person Voice

- Use "I" liberally to establish credibility
- Share what YOU learned, observed, experienced
- Avoid "one should" or passive constructions
- Make it personal: "I've never thought..." not "It's commonly believed..."

### Rhetorical Devices

- Parallel construction: "Every day... Every week... Every year..."
- Consequence chaining: Build cause and effect sequences
- Metaphors to make abstract concrete: "Every lie creates a debt"
- Reframes: Take common wisdom and flip it

### Reading Level

- Grade 6-8 (Hemingway App standard)
- Active voice, not passive
- Few adverbs
- Simple words over complex ones
- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Start" not "commence"

## Structure Pattern

1. **Opening hook** (1-2 sentences)
   - Credibility marker OR provocative statement
   - Example: "Friday marks my 20th anniversary at Meta."
   - Example: "I've never thought 'follow your passion' was good advice."

2. **Thesis** (1-2 sentences)
   - The core insight, stated directly
   - Don't bury the lead

3. **Exploration** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Develop the idea with examples
   - Acknowledge counterarguments
   - Show consequences of the alternative

4. **Integration/Conclusion** (1-2 sentences)
   - Tie it back together
   - Leave reader with the insight crystallized
   - Don't summarize; synthesize

## What to Avoid

- Bullet lists (essays flow)
- Headers in short posts (only for 400+ words if needed)
- Filler phrases: "In this article, I will discuss..."
- Hedging: "I think maybe possibly..."
- Exclamation marks
- Emojis
- Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "optimize"
- Starting sentences with "So" or "Well"

## Example Patterns

### Short punchy opener

"Dishonesty often looks efficient in the short term."

### Parallel construction

"You get better, you enjoy the work more, and the loop tightens."

### Consequence chain

"Eventually you burn out. Your work suffers. The company questions your judgment. Your options narrow. Resentment creeps in."

### Reframe

"The process wasn't inventing how to tell stories—it was discovering the ways audiences are inclined to engage."

### Personal credibility

"At Meta, I've taken every single day of vacation I've ever been offered."

### Insight crystallization

"That isn't indulgence. It's maintenance."
