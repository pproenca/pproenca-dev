# Storyteller Tactics Reference

Detailed frameworks for when you need to dig deeper.

## Story Structures (Detailed)

### No Easy Way (Pedro's Default)

Most credible arc. Acknowledges setbacks. Readers trust it.

| Beat | What Happens | Pedro's Version |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Problem | Bad place or unrealized potential | "I'd never done X before" |
| Early Success | Things start working | "Within hours I had..." |
| Setback | Reality hits | "Except here's what I learned..." |
| Crisis | Question everything | "The tests passed. The code was wrong." |
| Real Learning | Find true insight | "So I started treating it differently..." |
| Better Place | Win, but earned | Results + what changed in you |

### Voyage & Return

For discovery and exploration stories.

| Phase | Questions |
|-------|-----------|
| Home | Why were you restless? What itch needed scratching? |
| Voyage | What did you try? What surprised you? What pulled you back? |
| Return | How did you change? What do you see differently now? |

### Five Ts (Quick Structure)

For single-insight posts:

- **Timeline**: "At first... Then... Now..."
- **Turning Point**: The moment everything shifted
- **Tension**: Maximum conflict
- **Temptation**: When you could've quit or taken the easy way
- **Teachable**: The insight (embedded, not stated)

### POPP (Opinion/Argument Posts)

| Beat | Tone | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| Problem | Negative | What's broken, annoying, wrong |
| Opportunity | Positive | What could be better |
| Practical | Grounded | Here's how (with caveats) |
| Promise | Forward | What changes if we do this |

## Finding the Rolls Royce Moment

One vivid detail that tells the whole story.

**Ask:**
- What's the most specific moment?
- What would make someone laugh or wince?
- What plays like a movie scene?

**Test it:**
- Vivid: Can you see/hear/feel it?
- Exemplary: Does it stand for the whole experience?
- Relatable: Would another dev nod?

**Examples:**
- "At 60 mph, the loudest noise in the Rolls Royce comes from the electric clock."
- "Two days later, guess what I was debugging?"
- "Tests were green, things were compiling — but I was building on sand."

## Hooks (QUIRKS)

Open with something that stops the scroll:

| Type | Technique | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Question | Make them answer mentally | "What happens when your tests lie?" |
| Unexpected | Flip expectations | "I mass deleted 2,000 listings. On purpose." |
| Irony | Something ain't right | "The code worked. That was the problem." |
| Relatable | Direct address | "You've seen this error before." |
| Knowledge | Promise insight | "Three things I learned fighting C++" |
| Secret | Insider knowledge | "What the docs don't tell you about N-API" |

## Conflict Types

Every story needs friction:

| Type | Description | Pedro Example |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| vs Nature | Fighting systems, bugs, entropy | "C++ doesn't forgive" |
| vs Society | Fighting others, bureaucracy | "The spec said one thing, reality said another" |
| vs Self | Internal struggle | "I knew I should slow down but didn't" |

## Credibility Patterns

Build trust without bragging:

- **Hard-won**: "I got this wrong first" > "Here's how to do it"
- **Specific failure**: Name the exact mistake
- **Tool discovery**: "What saved me was..." (share the actual tool)
- **Time earned**: "After three days of this..." (show the grind)

## Voice Calibration

**Pedro sounds like:**
- "Here's the thing about..."
- "But here's what I learned..."
- "And that changed everything."
- "Except here's the uncomfortable truth..."
- "So I started treating it differently."
- "Two days. That's how much time I had."

**Pedro doesn't sound like:**
- "In this article, we will explore..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "Key takeaways include..."
- "To summarize..."

## The Pub Test

Read the draft aloud. Ask:
- Does this sound like explaining something to a smart friend?
- Would you actually say these words?
- Are there any sentences you'd be embarrassed to speak?

If it sounds like "content," rewrite it. If it sounds like a conversation, ship it.
