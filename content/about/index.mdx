I'm a Portuguese engineer who's spent the last decade building products and the teams behind them in Lisbon, Berlin, and now London.

I've built at scale. At Meta, I ran the teams responsible for CI/CD for WWW — the monorepo powering the backend of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Thousands of engineers shipping to billions of users. At OLX, I built the personalization team: ML systems powering hyper-local feeds for one of the world's largest classifieds platforms.

Now I'm at [TrustedHousesitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com), leading growth engineering teams. I'm building the team shipping marketing tools that convert at scale, and integrating gamification into the product to create a viral growth loop. Smaller company, bigger ownership.

I never stopped coding. That part's non-negotiable.

I'm currently building [node-webcodecs](https://github.com/pproenca/node-webcodecs) bringing the W3C WebCodecs API server-side through C++ bindings with FFmpeg. I write about growth engineering, people management and developer tools here, and I open source what I can.

I've grown engineers from junior to principal. IC7 at big tech. That might be the work I'm proudest of.
