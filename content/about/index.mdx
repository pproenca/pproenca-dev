I've been building products from scratch since 2012. An invoicing platform with one colleague. Marketplaces for exchanging goods across Europe. APIs serving millions of users.

Then I started building the teams that build the products.

At OLX, I built the personalization team — the ML models that powered hyper-local feeds globally. At Meta, I built the teams running CI/CD for the backend of nearly every product in the family of apps. Thousands of engineers shipping to billions of users.

I never stopped coding. That part's non-negotiable.

At [TrustedHousesitters](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com), I'm building two things: the team shipping tools that help marketing convert at scale, and the team integrating gamification into our product to create a viral growth engine.

Somewhere in there, I built an E2E testing framework for a legacy platform where unit tests weren't an option. Docker didn't exist yet. A thousand engineers ended up using it.

I've also grown engineers from junior to principal. IC7 at big tech. That might be the work I'm proudest of.

## Outside of Work

I'm usually deep in something technically complex — Raspberry Pis, Bluetooth security, whatever AI thing I'm learning that week. I open source as much as I can so others can learn too.

This is where I write about growth engineering, hardware projects, and the rabbit holes.
